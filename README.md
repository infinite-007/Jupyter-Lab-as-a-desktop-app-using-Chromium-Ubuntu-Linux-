# Jupyter-Lab-as-a-desktop-app-using-Chromium-Ubuntu-Linux
Running jupyter as chrome app is not possible through changing the jupyter-config file as mentioned in various internet blogs. Probably Chromumium being a snap app and due to snap's limitation, it cannot access the runtime file of Jupyter-lab. The other way is to run few commands into the terminal. 

With the help of a .desktop file in Ubuntu/linux one can put those commands as a script so that with double click, without any hassle to open terminal and type, one can easily open jupyter as a lab app. In this repository I have uploaded the .desktop file. Just copy it and paste it in your desktop and allow launching.
